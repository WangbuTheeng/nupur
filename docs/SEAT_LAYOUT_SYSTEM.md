## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure

The seat layout is stored as JSON in the `buses.seat_layout` column with the following structure:

```json
{
  "layout_type": "2x2",
  "total_seats": 31,
  "rows": 7,
  "columns": 5,
  "aisle_position": 2,
  "has_back_row": true,
  "back_row_seats": 5,
  "driver_seat": {
    "position": "top-right",
    "row": 0,
    "column": 5
  },
  "door": {
    "position": "top-left",
    "row": 0,
    "column": 0
  },
  "seats": [
    {
      "number": "A1",
      "row": 1,
      "column": 1,
      "type": "regular",
      "is_window": true,
      "is_aisle": false,
      "is_available": true,
      "side": "left"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. View the interactive seat map with:
   - Driver seat (top-right)
   - Front door (top-left)
   - Available seats (green)

## Configuration Options

### Layout Type Selection
```php
// Available layout types
$layoutTypes = [
    '2x2' => '2x2 (Standard)',
    '2x1' => '2x1 (Compact)', 
    '3x2' => '3x2 (Large)'
];
```

### Seat Count Recommendations
```php
$recommendations = [
    '2x2' => [27, 31, 35],
    '2x1' => [21, 25, 29],
    '3x2' => [35, 39, 45]
];
```

### Validation Rules
- Minimum seats: 10
- Maximum seats: 60
- Layout type must be valid
- Seat count must be feasible for selected layout

## Migration and Backward Compatibility

### Automatic Migration
The system includes a migration (`2025_07_12_000001_update_bus_seat_layouts_to_new_format.php`) that:
- Updates existing buses to new format
- Preserves existing seat data
- Determines optimal layout type based on seat count
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Legacy Support
- Old seat layout format is still supported
- API responses handle both old and new formats
- Gradual migration without service interruption

## Testing

### Unit Tests
**Location**: `tests/Unit/SeatLayoutServiceTest.php`

Tests cover:
- Layout generation for all types
- Seat numbering accuracy
- Window/aisle seat identification
- Back row generation
- Validation logic

### Running Tests
```bash
php artisan test tests/Unit/SeatLayoutServiceTest.php
```
